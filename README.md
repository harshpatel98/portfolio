This website was created using ReactJs from scratch and it covers majorty of the current web development skills.
A very unique feature about my website is that it uses many react libraries. The most noticeable being react-scroll.
React Scroll creates an animated scroll when clicking on link which redirects you to different sections of the page.

## Coding methods
- organized code to add or remove sections to the site

## Features included
- Adjustable Navbar, changes on phones and computer,
- universal screen size layout
- smooth scroll
- animated background
